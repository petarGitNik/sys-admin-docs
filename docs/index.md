This documentation is compilation of various tutorials, tips, and tricks that I gathered over time working as a system administrator. At this moment I mainly use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS operating system, so this manual will be oriented around it (and probably subsequent versions of Ubuntu).

    This documentation is in alpha phase.

## About resource redundancy

Each source in this documentation should have at least three links (one original, and two mirrors). Add mirrors using [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) and [archive.is](http://archive.is/).

## Notes about the documentation

Since I'm writing this introduction before any real content is written, this is what I expect this documentation to contain (and what is roughly done so far):

* [x] Initial server setup steps
* [x] Prometheus monitoring setup
* [x] Backup (various ways to do it, and scripts how to do it)
* [x] Basic security (working with SSH, `ufw`, `fail2ban`)
* [ ] Dealing with cache (i.e. redis-server)
* [ ] Working with apache
* [ ] Virtualization and automation
* [x] Working with databases
    * [x] MySQL
    * [x] PostgreSQL
* [ ] Password management

This is a lot to chew on. So this documentation will not aim to be comprehensive. Consider this as a proxy, or pointer if you will, to other resources, rather than all in one documentation.

!!! danger
    This is **not** an authoritative document, but it **is** highly opinionated.
